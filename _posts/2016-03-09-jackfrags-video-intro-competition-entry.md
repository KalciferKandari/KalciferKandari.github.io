In 2013 [jackfrags](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw7FkXsC00lH2v2yB5LQoYA "jackfrags") held a competition to design him a YouTube video intro:

These are videos created for that competition, using Adobe After Effects CS5.

## Intro 1

This is a simple intro in preparation for more complex animations.

## Outro 1

Very simple animation after Intro 1. Easiest for editing, anything could be done with the space, including clips of previous shows, links, credits, etc.
Can also be used interchangeably with Outro 2.

## Outro 2

More complicated animation. A section of the logo expands to reveal more of the footage behind, which could be a previous episode or anything you like. Again, any footage used can be replaced.
