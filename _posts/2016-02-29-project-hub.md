Started a lot of projects in the past few years and not published much information on them, that is about to change. Here are summaries of some of the projects. Links will be added when articles on them are written.

- **[A website engine]({% post_url 2016-02-29-website-engine-outline %}) in JavaScript, including the client, server, and data storage.**  
There are some aspects to websites that are mildly annoying and by now should have been solved, such as pages shifting while loading, redundant information requests, and automatical loading but no automatic unloading. Small things that take a lot of effort to fix.
- **A computer game engine.**  
Most computer games are in denial or inefficient. In denial because many do not present what *is* the case, such as ‘hit boxes’ being different from models, or trying to have humanoid characters where walking is not the method of locomotion. They are inefficient because at the cost of scale they priorities excessive polygon counts for severely diminishing returns to enjoyment, or hold information of objects that cannot be seen or touched. Subtle things that take a lot of effort to fix. More about these intricacies in another post.
- **A highly modular application/operating system engine.**  
Applications and operating systems are archaic. Applications are incredibly insecure, mostly custom written per application, and not crossplatform. Insecurity extends to operating systems, where applications are rarely properly sandboxed and have almost unlimited power in the system, the fact that applications don’t exploit that power is mostly because of laws that shouldn't need to be there. Users should have complete control of what the operating system, and applications do on a code-level, but now many don’t even allow the rebinding of hot-keys, never mind having main application functionality as modules. These are all major problems that take a lot of effort to fix. More about these glaring issues in another post that will go into more detail on operating system and application abstraction layers.
- **A hybrid 3D comic/animation series.**  
Movies and books usually completely void the concept of tension and suspense, by having immortal protagonists and clichés that telegraph what is next. Many glorify violence and battle without ever touching on the brutal consequences, collateral, and merciless suffering. Anything can happen at any time, there are no laws but the laws of physics, and this should be shown. More about a work that seeks not to fall to these flaws in another post.
- **A topological data redistribution library.**  
Decimating and interpolating surfaces in a meaningful way is not currently done well. It’s slow, inconsistent, and ineffective, especially on large amounts of data. These problems, and a solution will be covered in another post, and until then here is a sample, some [work done to convert an equirectangular digital elevation model (DEM) to a Dymaxion DEM](http://bioticpixels.com/articles/dymaxion/ "bioticpixels.com/articles/dymaxion").
- **A book.**  
More on the flaws of movies and books, making up for the disappointment of super heroes and their consequences, and the oversight of their powers. More about these intricacies in another post.
- **A method of writing.**  
The discontinuities and downfalls of many works of entertainment can be corrected by a thorough, and technical method of writing, which applies to all medium, from books to story-driven computer games. This will be detailed in another post.
